TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_bd_top_clk_wiz_3_0 and clk_cpu_bd_top_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_bd_top_clk_wiz_3_0] -to [get_clocks clk_cpu_bd_top_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning

No common phase between related clocks from parallel MMCMs or PLLs  
The clocks clk_out1_bd_top_clk_wiz_3_0 and clk_cpu_bd_top_clk_wiz_0_0 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel MMCMs or PLLs and at least one of the block's clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all parallel MMCMs or PLLs must have the clock divider set to 1.

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -include_replicated_objects -filter {NAME =~ *temp_mon_enabled.u_tempmon/device_temp_sync_r1_reg[*]/D}]' of constraint 'set_max_delay' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '18' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
